### TECHNICAL-NOTES-FOR-HOPLINKS

Your ClickBank HopLink should be formed like this:

http://YOURAFFILIATEID.interview.hop.clickbank.net
(you send traffic to my site using this link so you get paid)

or maybe like this:

https://hop.clickbank.net/?affiliate=YOURAFFILIATEID&vendor=interview

Once encrypted, your HopLink might look something like this:
https://dcb8e1n7uk1rel69sjvbi6sx1s.hop.clickbank.net
(ClickBank Encrypts all HopLinks)

Learn more about HopLinks: https://support.clickbank.com/hc/en-us/articles/220365867-HopLinks-Guide, and here TLDR: https://monetizedfuture.com/how-to-create-clickbank-hoplink/

If you want, I have ClickBank's "Direct Offer Tracking" set up, so you can promote using either a traditional HopLink, or "Direct Tracking" – which has a few advantages. Direct Tracking is not replacing the ClickBank HopLink. HopLinks are still a highly reliable tracking mechanism. You can use either or both.

### TECHNICAL-NOTE-ABOUT-IMAGES

To make the images look their best on your site, scale them down in your HTML, not in your image editor. For example, the image `INTERVIEW-cover-on-orange-landscape-OG-1200x675.png` is 1200x675px — but you can scale it smaller in your HTML image tag by HALVING the width, like this:

`<img src="INTERVIEW-cover-on-orange-landscape-OG-1200x675.png" width="600" height="auto">`

Now it displays at half the size (600 width instead of 1200) so with this code you are scaling the image by 50%, making it look SHARPER and BETTER on your page.

#### ANOTHER IMAGE TAG EXAMPLE

Please don't scale down my profile pic in your image editor, scale it in the HTML, like this:

`<img src="INTERVIEW-bob-firestone-profile-pic-2024-800x800.jpg" width="250" height="auto">`

... to show it at 250x250 (or whatever) even though the image is 800x800 pixels.

Look in the `images` folder to find all the images, along with URLs to all the images on my fast public CDN so you can link to those from your site if you want to, instead of hosting them yourself. Image URLs are also listed here:
